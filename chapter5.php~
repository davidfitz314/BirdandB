	<h2>Chapter 5: What is Sex?</h2>
	<h4>Defining Sex</h4>
	</p>Sex is either of the two major forms of individuals that occur in many species that are distinguished respectively as female or male especially on the basis of their reproductive organs and structures. -Merriam Webster.</p>
	
	<p>Sex is also a term used to describe the action of reproduction in species regardless of gender, but the technical word for sex actions is Sexual Intercourse. The most common type of sexual intercourse is hetero-sexual Intercourse, also known as the act of penetration of the vagina by a penis. </p>

	<h4>Types of Sex</h4>
	<p>There are many different types of sex and sexual activities. While the most generally accepted is heterosexual sex (male and female sex), the others are also quite common in today's world even if they are not as talked about openly. The following list is a few of the most common types of sex:</p>
	<ul class="solidCircle">
		<li><strong>Vaginal Sex:</strong> commonly referred to as heterosexual sex, is the act of a penis entering the vagina.</li>

		<li><strong>Anal Sex:</strong> The stimulation or penetration of the anus by another person.</li>
	<!- Interesting Fact goes here ->
		
		<li><strong>Oral Sex:</strong> The stimulation of sexual organs by use of another person’s mouth or tongue.</li>

		<li><strong>Sex Toys:</strong> The act of using an object on sexual organs to produce climax in sexual response.</li>

		<li><strong>Penetrative Sex:</strong> When something goes inside someone else’s body, this includes objects, genitalia, and other body parts entering another’s body.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Sexual Activities</h4>
	<p>Sex is not only Penetrative into another’s body, it can be divided into acts which involve one person, also called autoeroticism (the sexual gratification obtained solely through stimulation by oneself of one's own body.), two or more people having sex or mutual masturbation, or if there are more than two participants in the sex act it may be referred to as group sex.</p>

	<p><strong>Sexual activity</strong> is slightly different than sex because it can be classified into sexual orientations, relationships, and genders of the participants. A quick look at how they categorize sexual activity is listed below:</p>
	<ul class="solidCircle">
		<li>Sexual orientations can include same sex, opposite sex biology, object sex, and any other attraction that leads to sexual activity based on looks.</li>

		<li>Relationships can include marriages, intimate partners, casual sex partners, or anonymous.</li>

		<li>Gender of the participants usually goes along with sexual orientations, but they exclude objects. For example, gender of participants can be into same sex biologically but exclude the use of objects in their activities.</li>

	<p>Sexual activity can be regarded in terms of cultural as conventional or alternative. Where a sexual activity in one culture may be regarded as conventional, in a separate culture that same activity could be considered alternative. This is seen regularly in places with different ages of consent for sex. Besides cultural differences, sexual activity can be categorized as fetishm, paraphillia, or BDSM activities. For more information on fetishes, BDSM and kinks please visit <a href="chapter12.php">Chapter 12 Kinks & Fetishes</a>.</p>

	<p>Finally sexual activity has different levels of consent. If all parties agree to the sexual activity it is regarded as consensual. However, in the event where one or more does not consent it becomes regarded as sexual assault or rape, and different laws can criminalize the aggressor. For more information of Sexual Assault or Sexual Rape please visit the following chapters: <a href="chapter15.php">Chapter 15 Sexual Assault</a> / <a href="chapter16.php">Chapter 16 Sexual Rape</a>.</p>
