<h2>Chapter 6: Sexuality</h2>
	<h3>Sexual Identity</h3>

	<ol>
		<li>First look at yourself? Do you see more masculine or feminine features?</li>

		<li>Second how do you feel about your features? They may look masculine or feminine but do you want to still call them that?</li>

		<li>Third decide for yourself what you want identify as. Boy, girl, trans, etc…</li>

		<li>Fourth think about what makes you feel sexual. You can write it down so that you always have a way of remembering your favorite sexualities of yourself.</li>

		<li>Fifth Learn about your sexual preferences.</li>
		<ul class="openCircle">
			<li>Do you like males, females, trans, others?</li>
		</ul>

		<li>Sixth learn about your sexual preferences that others would call kinks or fetishes.</li>
		<ul class="openCircle">
			<li>Having a fetish or kink is never a bad thing unless it harms the other person against their will, so feel free to explore the options out there.</li>
		</ul>

	<h4>Sexual Preference</h4>
	<p>Sexual preference, also known as sexual orientation, is a repeating pattern of romantic, sexual attraction, or a mix of the two to people of the opposite sex or gender, to both sexes, or more than one gender. These attractions are generally included under heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality, while asexuality -the lack of sexual attraction to others- is only occasionally identified as a fourth category.</p>


	<h5>Genders</h5>
	<p>The state of being male or female, these are usually used in reference to social and cultural differences instead of the biological ones.</p>

	<p>Genders are a choice in the way that if people feel they are more feminine than masculine even though they were born with the biological traits of a male, they may choose to change their gender as a part of their sexual identity. While many may wish to identify as a different gender than the one they were born with physically, remember that society still holds norms and laws related to the biological gender. However, there are options out there to modify the biological gender into what the person feels more comfortable with.</p>

	<h5>Sex</h5>
	<p>In relation towards biology, sex is the reproductive organs that people are born with. It consists of three categories Males with XY chromosomes, Females with XX chromosomes, or Transgendered which can be a mixture of different chromosomes other than the common male and female pattern for chromosomes. For more information on Sex in regards to sexual activity please see <a href="chapter5.php">Chapter 5: What is Sex</a>.</p>
