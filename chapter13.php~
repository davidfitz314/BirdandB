	<h3>What is Sexual Harassment</h3>
	</p>Sexual Harassment is very different from sexual assault, but the two do relate to each other. Sexual harassment is a form of gender discrimination that involves unwelcome sexual advances, sexualized jokes or comments, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.</p>

	<p>Sexual harassment is generally broken down into 2 categories, Quid Pro Quo and Hostile Environment:</p>

			</p><strong class="addItalic">Quid Pro Quo</strong> is when conditions are placed on a person’s career or terms of employment for sexual favors. It involves threats of adverse actions or promises of favorable actions depending on the responses of the victim.</p>

			</p><strong class="addItalic">Hostile Environment</strong> is when a person is subjected to offensive, unwanted, and unsolicited comments and behavior of a sexual nature that interferes with that person’s work or performance. It is usually referenced towards the workplace but hostile environments can be any location that a person is required to be at.</p>

	</p><strong class="addItalic">Sexual harassment</strong> is unfortunately very common, below is a quote from the Huffington Post for a female’s experience as a young teen with sexual harassment:</p>

	<p class="tabbedB"><i>“When I was 14 I worked at Tim Hortons in Canada. While I was working I had an older man, looked to be in his 60s or 70s, tells me that he couldn’t sleep at night without me beside him in his bed and asked if I would come home with him. I was absolutely disgusted that a man would say that to me as a child.” — Emma, 26”</i>(Agrawal, N. 2015)</p>

		<div class="ch13Right">
			<p><strong class="addItalic2">Sexual harassment does not have to be in person, as technology changes and grows, sexual harassment also expands. Text messages, chat rooms, phone calls, social media, and more are used to sexually harass other people.</strong></p>

	</div>

	<h4>Sexual Harassment Statistics</h4>
	<p>Sexual harassment is very common, the most reported location to be sexually harassed is the workplace. In a survey done by <a href="http://www.aware.org/" target="_blank">AWARE (Association of Women for Action and Research)</a> in 2008 they analyzed 92 different companies and gathered 500 respondents data.</p>

	<ul class="closedCircle">
		<li>54% (272) had experienced some form of workplace sexual harassment.</li>

		<li>79% of the victims are women; 21% were men.</li>

		<li>66.6% (333) were not aware of any policies for preventing sexual harassment.</li>

		<li>50.4% indicated that they were aware of a department or resource person they could approach on sexual harassment.</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="ch13Images">
		<img src="includes/images/chapter13/dualharrassment.png" alt="Male sexually harassing female and a female sexually harassing a male">
	</div>

	<p>These statistics show that both biological genders experience sexual harassment, but barely half of them know what to do about it or where they can go to find out more information. While many companies are progressively pushing to have better policies to cover this problem, it still requires each person to help. If you or someone you know has been sexually harassed or assaulted please document it, and report it to the proper authorities (police, human resources, etc...) and then follow up on it. Only by doing this can sexual harassment and assault be stopped</p>

	<h3>What is Sexual Assault &amp; Rape</h3>

Sexual assault has no age limits, there have been many cases where children and elderly have been sexually assaulted.</p>

	<p><strong class="addItalic">Rape</strong> is a form of sexual assault or sexual violence.

	<h4>Sexual Assault or Harassment Legalities</h4>
	<p>Sexual assault is a statutory offense that states that it is a crime to knowingly cause another person to engage in an unwanted sexual act by force or threat.<br> Many states have gone through and redefined rape with statutes that define sexual assault in different degrees. This means that sexual assault can be connected to rape, but with the revised version of rape not all sexual assault acts are included as a rape incident.<br><strong class="addItalicB"> To find out more details or specifics please visit your local legal associations or community resources.</strong></p>

	<h3>Sexual Violence Prevention</h3>
	<h4>Be Prepared & Stay Calm</h4>
	<p>This doesn’t mean, let the perpetrator do whatever they want, what this means is think of a plan of escape. While immediately fighting feels like a good idea, many sexual violence cases have a perpetrator that is physically stronger or a better fighter than the victim. So to solve this, one must stay calm and think of a plan.</p>
