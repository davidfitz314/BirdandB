<h2>Chapter 12: Kinks and Fetishes</h2>
	<h3>What is a Fetish &amp; Kink</h3>
	</p>A fetish or kink is a form of sexual desire in which gratification is linked to an abnormal degree to a particular object, item of clothing, part of the body, or etc. Fetishes are generally an excessive and irrational devotion or commitment to a particular thing. They can be an inanimate object worshiped for its supposed magical powers, or because it is considered to be inhabited by a spirit or something else.</p>

	<h4>Do I Have to Like Their Fetish</h4>
	<p>Each person has the chance to have a fetish, whether it be to specific body parts, clothing, or more. When interacting with someone who has expressed their fetish to you verbally it is important to understand their opinion, but that does not mean you have to also engage in their fetish.</p>

	<p>To the other person a fetish can be a healthy way to relieve sexuality, sensuality, and sexual desires. Accepting someone’s fetish is simply a way of accepting another person as a friend, and while they may enjoy their fetish, you are never required to do everything they want to. Instead be their friends, but make clear where your stance is on the subject.</p>

	<h4>How Common are Fetishes?</h4>
	<p class="addItalic">According to a survey done by Ann Summers in the UK approximately 75% of people have at least one fetish.<br>In an article from Women’s Health by Debra W. Soh, the amount of people with a fetish is 1 in 6. While more stats on sexual fetishes may be hard to find, the Mark Allen Thorton blog published a statistic evaluating the authors of over 2900 books, and graphed them out based on the age group focuses the books were written for. In his studies fetishes were common and varied by different age groups.</p>

	<h3>Common Fetishes and Kinks</h3>
	</p>Their are plenty of fetishes in today’s world. Below is a compilation of some of the most reported fetishes that are also related to sexuality.</p>

		<p><strong>Adult babies:</strong> are those individuals that enjoy being a baby again. They may enjoy regressing partially or completely, participating in the act of wearing diapers, being fed by an adult, sucking on a baby bottle or pacifier, dressing up in baby clothes, crawling instead of walking and speaking in “baby” talk. Individuals interested in infantilism most likely enjoy the nurturing aspect. They may be seeking attention or have too many responsibilities in their daily lives, which they wish to escape from.</p>

		<p><strong>Swinging:</strong> refers to the act of a committed, usually married couple indulging in sex with another couple or individual with the full consent of both partners.
