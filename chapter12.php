<h2>Chapter 12: Kinks and Fetishes</h2>
	<h3>What is a Fetish &amp; Kink</h3>
	</p>A fetish or kink is a form of sexual desire in which gratification is linked to an abnormal degree to a particular object, item of clothing, part of the body, or etc. Fetishes are generally an excessive and irrational devotion or commitment to a particular thing. They can be an inanimate object worshiped for its supposed magical powers, or because it is considered to be inhabited by a spirit or something else.</p>

	<h4>Do I Have to Like Their Fetish</h4>
	<p>Each person has the chance to have a fetish, whether it be to specific body parts, clothing, or more. When interacting with someone who has expressed their fetish to you verbally it is important to understand their opinion, but that does not mean you have to also engage in their fetish.</p>

	<p>To the other person a fetish can be a healthy way to relieve sexuality, sensuality, and sexual desires. Accepting someone’s fetish is simply a way of accepting another person as a friend, and while they may enjoy their fetish, you are never required to do everything they want to. Instead be their friends, but make clear where your stance is on the subject.</p>

	<h4>How Common are Fetishes?</h4>
	<p class="addItalic">According to a survey done by Ann Summers in the UK approximately 75% of people have at least one fetish.<br>In an article from Women’s Health by Debra W. Soh, the amount of people with a fetish is 1 in 6. While more stats on sexual fetishes may be hard to find, the Mark Allen Thorton blog published a statistic evaluating the authors of over 2900 books, and graphed them out based on the age group focuses the books were written for. In his studies fetishes were common and varied by different age groups.</p>

	<h3>Common Fetishes and Kinks</h3>
	</p>Their are plenty of fetishes in today’s world. Below is a compilation of some of the most reported fetishes that are also related to sexuality.</p>

		<p><strong>Adult babies:</strong> Are those individuals that enjoy being a baby again. They may enjoy regressing partially or completely, participating in the act of wearing diapers, being fed by an adult, sucking on a baby bottle or pacifier, dressing up in baby clothes, crawling instead of walking and speaking in “baby” talk. Individuals interested in infantilism most likely enjoy the nurturing aspect. They may be seeking attention or have too many responsibilities in their daily lives, which they wish to escape from.</p>

		<p><strong>Foot Fetishism:</strong> Is surprisingly common. It is the most common fetish of the non-genital body parts and non-sexual objects. Sigmund Freud offered the explanation that people develop this fetish due to the fact that the human foot resembles a penis. But Freud’s theory on this fetish has yet to be proven.</p>

		<p><strong>Rubber/Latex/Leather:</strong> This fetish relates to those that gain sexual enjoyment by wearing or having their partner wear rubber, latex or leather material. They refer to themselves as “<i>rubberists</i>”. The tight material acts as a type of sexual bondage. For some, the smell of rubber/latex/leather may also be a turn on. The fetish can range from wearing the more conventional types of items such as a cat suit to something more unusual such as a gas mask.</p>

		<p><strong>Sexual Role-play:</strong> Involves two or more individuals acting out different roles in a sexual scenario. It can be any type of sexual fantasy.

It may involve individuals assuming a participating role or that of a spectator. Technology has now brought about the possibility of sexual role-playing on the Internet as well, which many individuals and couples indulge in.</p>

		<p><strong>Domination &amp; Submission:</strong> is a part of an acronym most people may be familiar with called <strong><i>BDSM</i></strong>. It stands for bondage, domination and submission, sadism and masochism.  The dictionary defines domination and submission as “a set of behaviors, customs, and rituals involving the giving by one individual to another individual control over them”. It involves the power exchange between two consenting adults. This can be in the form of a one-time occurrence, a specific part time situation or a full time arrangement. The submissive does what the dominant requires within their agreed boundaries of comfort.</p>

		<p class="addItalic">According to Debby Herbenick, a sexual health educator at the Kinsey Institute and author of Sex Made Easy, “BDSM is a huge umbrella term for a wide range of activities, from fuzzy handcuffs you can buy at a women-oriented sex boutique to the more extreme sexual dungeon set-up.” Interestingly enough BDSM has become more mainstream within the last 20 years as evidenced by the very popular 50 Shades of Grey novel.</p>
