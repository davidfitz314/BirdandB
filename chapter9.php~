<h2>Chapter 9: Staying Safe During Sex</h2>
	<a NAME="safe_sex"></a>
	<h3>Safe Sex</h3>
	</p>Safe sex is a way to combine the greatest pleasure while having the least amount of risk for contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Safe sex besides protecting a person can also help communication and trust between partners. There are two main groups to safe sex, the safest sex and regular safe sex:</p>

	<p>The safest sex doesn’t involve penetration or the having genitals touch the partner, by doing this, STI’s have no access method from one person to another. A few methods for safest sex involve:</p>

	<ul class="closedCircle">
		<li>Fantasizing or having phone sex.</li>

		<li>Touching one's own body  erotically (masturbation) or having each partner touch their own body at the same time (mutual masturbation).</li>

		<li>Caressing one’s partner using non-sexual massage.</li>

		<li>Rubbing against one’s partner’s body while wearing clothes.</li>

		<li>Kissing one’s partner everywhere except for the genital regions.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>On a daily basis many people choose safe sex and safest sex. The most used reasons are:</p>
	<ul class="closedCircle">
		<li>Safe sex prevents some STI’s.</li>

		<li>Safe sex prevents pregnancies.</li>

		<li>Finances, children can cost a lot and people are not prepared financially yet.</li>

		<li>Safe sex builds trust among partners.</li>

		<li>Safe sex helps build emotional bonds with partners.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Whether the protection being used is prescribed or non-prescription, they each have a timeframe for when they can be used and how often they can be used. Remember to always check the packaging and healthcare professionals for the time sensitive information and other related information for protection.</p>

	<h4 class="addItalic">Where to Acquire Protection</h4>
	<p>At most grocery stores and gas stations in the US, a variety of non-prescriptions protections like condoms, spermicide, and lubricants are available for purchase.</p>

	<p>One may schedule a doctor’s appointment with an approved physician to get a prescription protection.</p>

	<p>In the event that one is unable to financially purchase protections, there are still a few options available. Wellness Centers and Planned Parenthood both offer cheaper prescription protections if not free based on the amount of income one has. These places also usually offer a non-prescription condoms for free for all who just come in.</p>

	<h3>Abstinence</h3>
	<p>Abstinence is a valid way to protect oneself from STI’s and pregnancy. Abstinence is the practice of restraining oneself from indulging in something.</p>

	<p>Many people choose abstinence and each have their own reasons for it, but a few of the most common reasons are:</p>

	<ul class="closedCircle">
		<li>Waiting for the right person to be sexually active with.</li>

		<li>Mourning the loss of a significant other.</li>

		<li>Focusing on work or education.</li>

		<li>Recovering from an illness.</li>

		<li>Maintaining a moral or religious principle.</li>
	</ul>

<h4 class="addItalic">Is abstinence right for you?</h4>

	<ul class="closedCircle">
		<li>The choice of abstinence or not is always up to the person. If one chooses yes or no then that is your answer. One should never let someone else make this choice for you, as this is your body and not theirs.</li>
	</ul>
