	<h2>Chapter 3: Human Body Development</h2>
	<h4>Pre-Puberty Changes</h4>
	<p>Quite a few changes happen before even entering the puberty stage, most children will:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Become stronger as their muscles increase in mass.</li>
	<li>Improve their motor skills strength and coordination.</li>
	<li>Have their skin gradually change texture and appearance to be more like an adults.</li>
	<li>And in some cases hair color darkens.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>These changes happen naturally but at varying degrees to children, so no one child is exactly alike another.</p>

	<h4>Puberty For Males</h4>
	<p>Early signs of puberty in males usually start 1 year later than females. The first sign is Testes(plural for testicle) growing larger and the Scrotum thinning and reddening. This happens generally around 11 years of age but can actually start early or later usually between 9 and 14yrs old.</p>
	
	<p>The second major puberty sign, growth spurts, usually happen 2 years after males have begun puberty.</p>
	<!- Interesting Fact goes here ->
	
	<p>Puberty for males can be a very confusing time, they will be going about many different changes in their physiology and hormones. The following is a list of changes that generally happen in males to a greater or lesser extent.</p>
	
	<ul><li>Testicles and Scrotum enlarges:</li>
		<ul><li>The testicles and Scrotum sac will enlarge to nearly double their previous size and the scrotum will darken, thin, and hang down from the body with tiny bumps dotted on it for where hair follicles will later grow.</li></ul>
	<!- Interesting Fact goes here ->
		
		<li>Pubic Hair:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>At first only a few light-colored pubic hairs will appear at the base of the penis, but as puberty continues they will become darker, thicker and curlier. In males the pattern of hair growth is similar to a diamond shape, It will first cover the pubic region and then spread toward the thighs and up to the naval.</li>
			<li>Approximately 2 years after the first pubic hairs appear, males will start to develope hair on their face, legs, arms and underarms and even later in the chest area.</li>
		</ul>

		<li>Penis growth:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>First the male’s penis will grow in length and then in width. A male can have adult sized genitals anywhere between the ages of 13 and 18 years old.</li>
			<li>Many males at this stage will become worried about their penis size or length not being correct, since males develop at different rates having a medical professional exam them and telling them that they are normal can improve their self esteem and put their worries to rest.</li>

		<li>Body Shape Changes:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Males just prior to and at the beginning of puberty tend to look chubby and gangly (long arms and legs connected to a trunk like torso), but as puberty begins they generally experience a growth spurt which balances out their proportions and doesn’t end until the later stages of sexual maturation.</li>
			<li>Up unto the middle of adolescence Males and Females had a similar level of strength. After the middle of adolescence though males keep gaining muscle mass  whereas females slow down, so much so that by the late teens, a male’s body composition is generally only 12 percent body fat and the females body fat is composition is nearly double or more of the males.</li>
		</ul>

		<li>Wet dreams, Involuntary Erections and Fertility:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Around 1 year after the male’s testicles enlarge the male ejaculates, this is when most consider the male to be fertile and able to procreate. The testicles in males should now be producing both testosterone and sperm, while the prostate, the 2 seminal vesicles and the Cowper’s glands secrete other fluids that combine with the sperm to form semen.</li>
			<li>Nocturnal Emissions also known as wet dreams are spontaneous orgasms with ejaculation during sleep. They are most common in males during adolescence and young adult years, but they can happen anytime after puberty has begun.</li>
<!- Interesting Fact goes here ->
			<li>Involuntary Erections are quite common in adolescent males. They can be caused by just about anything that increases the blood flow in the body or from their own body dealing with puberty. If males are nervous or are doing extraneous physical activity the increased blood flow can cause an involuntary erection and if the male is completely calm their body may still experience an involuntary erection.</li>
		</ul>

		<li>Voice Change:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Just after the male’s growth spurt peaks, the larynx and vocal cords grow larger. During this enlargement period many males voices “crack” as they talk, but the cracking will usually stop after the voice box has matured.</li>
		</ul>

		<li>Breast Development:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Many males in early puberty will experience soreness or tender in their nipple region and 3 out of 4 males will experience some breast growth. This is caused by a biochemical reaction that changes some of the male’s testosterone into the female hormone estrogen. If the firm of the breast bud is more extensive than 2 inches in diameter under the nipples it can be result in gynecomastia. Overweight males may have lipomastia which appears like a pseudo-gynecomastia, because of the excess fatty tissue on the chest wall.</li>
		</ul>
